# Express In depth

In this module, we were taught how to use HTTP verbs to perform CRUD operations. And how API calls work.

### Tasks

- Setup an API that when called will return a new random dad’s joke from
  [RapidDadJokes](https://rapidapi.com/KegenGuyll/api/dad-jokes) - You can create an account for yourself or can use the api-key below to gain access to the dad jokes api, mind you if you decide to use your own account, remember to subscribe to dad jokes before your api key will work. - You can do this in the pricing section of the dashboard.
